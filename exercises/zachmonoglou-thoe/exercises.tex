Prove that a closed set contains all of its boundary points while an open set contains none of its boundary points.
\begin{proof}
Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a closed set. This implies that $A$ contains all
of its limit points. Now suppose the point $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a boundary
point of the set $A$. This implies that every ball with center at $x$ contains
points
of $A$ and points of $A^c$. It then follows, from the definition of a limit point,
that $x$ is itself a limit point of $A$. Then since we know $A$ contains all
of its limit points then it follows that $x \in A$, as desired. \newline
\indent Now let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be an open set. This implies that every
point of $A$ is an interior point, futher implying that $A$ contains none of its
limit points. Since we just showed that boundary points are also limit points,
it must be that $A$ contains none of its boundary points, as desired.
\end{proof}
